# CSS GRID LAYOUT 

This is a toy project to experiment with css layouts.  I will probably include various pages with code redundancy so as to provide each example in as self contained a manner as possible.

##  NPM / NODE / BROWSER SYNC 

This runs with live updating.  From the directory with package.json run npm i  then npm start.
